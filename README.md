## 📘 Overview

This project focuses on mastering annotations in Java. The exercises explore both built-in and custom annotations, demonstrating how they improve functionality, readability, and maintainability in object-oriented programming. Topics include `@Override`, `@Deprecated`, and a user-defined annotation designed for object serialization.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Java 21  
- IntelliJ IDEA  
- Git

## 🧩 Structure & Levels

| Level | Exercise | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1     | 1        | Class hierarchy: `Worker`, `OnlineWorker`, and `OnsiteWorker`. Subclasses override `calculateSalary()` using `@Override`. `OnsiteWorker` adds fuel cost; `OnlineWorker` includes internet flat rate. |
| 1     | 2        | Add deprecated methods using `@Deprecated`. Call them from an external class and suppress warnings with `@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")`. |
| 2     | 1        | Create a custom annotation to serialize objects into JSON format. Accepts an output directory as a parameter. |
